# aioairq
Python library to retrieve data asynchronous from air-Q.

This is primarily thought for the implementation of the air-Q plugin for [home-assistant](https://github.com/CorantGmbH/home-assistant-core), but may also be helpfull in general.

This will be published on PyPI when finished.

* For creation followed the guidlines [here](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/python-for-hpc/tutorials/python-pypi-packaging/)
